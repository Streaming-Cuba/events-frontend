## How set up local environment
To set up your local development environment you only need download
the source code and install the dependencies to run it.

If you use NPM run:
```cmd
> npm install
```

If you use Yarn run instead:
```cmd
> yarn
```

We very recommend use Yarn for more speed and security with 
the dependencies' management.
